You got Claude doing something just right. You share it, and for everyone else it falls
flat, because it quietly leaned on *your* setup. skillc is a **skill that makes skills**:
tell it what you want, show it a couple of examples you like, and it hands you one file
you can send to anyone.

What makes the file different is what is inside it. It does not carry finished
instructions; it carries the examples you approved, plus a recipe. The first time
someone uses it, their Claude rebuilds the skill against its own setup, tests itself on
a few examples it was never shown, and reports a score. So the skill works there, or it
says plainly that it does not, instead of quietly doing the wrong thing.

## Get skillc

Install it once, like any skill.

- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add baron-3dl/skillc`, then
  `/plugin install skillc@skillc`.
- **claude.ai:** download
  [skillc.zip](https://github.com/baron-3dl/skillc/releases/latest/download/skillc.zip),
  turn on "Code Execution and File Creation" (Settings, then Capabilities), then upload
  the zip under Customize, then Skills (the "+" button, then "Upload a skill").
- **OpenCode:** unzip skillc.zip into `~/.claude/skills/`; it is picked up automatically.

Skills work on every Claude plan, Free included. The claude.ai Code Execution switch is a
one-time toggle.

## Use it

Just ask, in plain words:

    skillc, make me a skill that writes my emails in my voice

It asks a few questions (what you want, a couple of examples you like, your taste), shows
you a test, and you say "yes" or "tweak that." Then it hands you the finished skill as
one file.

## Share what you make

Send the file to anyone. They install it the same way you installed skillc above. The
first time they use it, it sets itself up against their Claude, grades itself on examples
you approved, and tells them how well it transferred. If it cannot work there, it says so
instead of quietly doing the wrong thing.

## No install? Paste it instead

If you would rather not install anything, skillc also runs as a paste-in prompt: copy
[make-a-skill.md](make-a-skill.md) into a chat and answer its questions. Same builder, no
setup. The skill it gives you can be pasted the same way, or saved in a Project to reuse.

## For developers

The install above uses skillc's Claude Code plugin marketplace, which also lets you version
and distribute skills as files. The worked example skills are a separate plugin,
`skillc-examples` (voice, explain-plainly, commit-message); install it too if you want the
demos:

    /plugin install skillc-examples@skillc

Update later with `/plugin marketplace update`. Or clone the repo as a plain skill
instead:

    git clone https://github.com/baron-3dl/skillc ~/.claude/skills/skillc

**Author a shareable skill.** With the builder installed, tell Claude what you want to
capture. The input can be a skill you already run, a few examples you like, or a style you
describe:

    build a skill from these examples
    build a self-building skill from <a skill you already have>

Claude follows `seed/builder.skill.md`: it gathers approved examples (by running a skill
you have, taking examples you paste, or drafting and letting you correct), buckets them by
behavioral move, holds a few back as acceptance examples, declares any genuinely local
dependencies as binds, distills your corrections into checks, and writes one file:
`<name>.selfbuild.SKILL.md`. This is the same builder as the make-a-skill prompt at the
top, just installed instead of pasted.

**Share it.** Send that one file. There is nothing else to ship. The receiver drops it
in `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, uploads it on the claude.ai skills page, or keeps it in
a repo's `.claude/skills/`.

**Use one you received.** Install it and use the skill normally. The first time, before
its first answer, it runs its own rebuild recipe (`seed/rebuild.skill.md`): it resolves
any binds against your tools, rebuilds its instructions against the author's build
examples in your session, scores the held-back acceptance examples, and states one line:

    Built. Build examples matched 4 of 4, acceptance score 0.9. Ready.

or, honestly, `Built, but could not reach the author's quality here ...` with the gap,
or `Cannot build: this skill needs <tool>, which is not available here.` Then it
answers, checking each answer against the checks before sending.

### On claude.ai (web chat)

claude.ai cannot use the plugin marketplace (that is Claude Code only), and the operating
point is your account's memory, custom instructions, and active style. It takes a skill as
an uploaded ZIP, so the flow is download then upload:

1. Turn on code execution: Settings, then Capabilities, then enable "Code Execution and
   File Creation" (Skills require it).
2. Download the skill you want from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/baron-3dl/skillc/releases/latest). Each skill is its
   own zip: `voice.zip`, `explain-plainly.zip`, `commit-message.zip`, or `skillc.zip` for
   the builder.
3. Upload it: Customize, then Skills, then the "+" button, then "Upload a skill", then
   the zip.
4. Use the skill. On first use it self-builds against your web session and reports the
   one-line outcome, then answers.

Two honest limits on web chat. The self-build runs in a single conversation, so it partly
grades against examples it can see (blindness is softer than in Claude Code, which can
spawn a separate grader). And binds resolve only against connected tools, not local
command-line tools, so a pure-carry skill (voice, explain-plainly) transfers fully while a
skill that binds a local-only tool fails loud there, by design.

**Making a skill on claude.ai, and sharing it out.** You can author there too. Install
`skillc.zip` (the builder), then in the chat ask it to build a self-building skill from
the one you have been iterating; it harvests examples (you approve each), and with code
execution on it writes the finished `<name>.selfbuild.SKILL.md` to the session for you to
download. Pure-carry skills build fully here, since your account is the operating point
they should match; a skill that binds a local tool you can still author (you declare the
bind in plain words), you just cannot test that bind without the tool, which is where
Claude Code helps.

Sharing it out is the part claude.ai does not do for you: there is no publish button and
no skill gallery. You distribute the file yourself, either by handing it to people (they
upload it to their own claude.ai or drop it in Claude Code), or by putting it in a GitHub
repo with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (as this repo does) so Claude Code users
add it with `/plugin marketplace add you/repo` and claude.ai users download it from the
release. claude.ai is make-and-use; GitHub is the distribution layer.

## Why this exists

A hand-tuned skill picks up hidden dependencies on your setup: your tools, your memory,
your custom instructions. It behaves like a dynamically-linked binary. On anyone else's
machine those dependencies resolve to something different, or to nothing, and it does
not fail loud like a missing shared library; it quietly produces the wrong thing. The
fix is to ship source that rebuilds in place, with every dependency declared on purpose:
**carry** what defines the output (bundled in, the same everywhere), **bind** what is
genuinely local (resolved against the receiver, failed loud when missing).

## How it works

**The author approves examples.** You give the builder a few real inputs and the output
you want for each: run a skill you already use, paste examples you like, or let it draft
and correct it. You never write a gold answer from scratch; you bless the good ones.
Approved pairs become **build examples**, grouped by behavioral move; a few are held
back as **acceptance examples**. More good examples in, better skill out. That is your
lever.

**What gets shipped** is one file containing: the definition of good output inlined in
full; any local dependencies as binds in plain words; the build examples; the held-back
acceptance examples; the checks (the hard rules, kept from your corrections); and the
rebuild recipe.

**The receiver's Claude rebuilds it.** On first use, before answering, it resolves the
binds (and stops, naming any that are missing), writes itself instructions and retries
until the build examples reproduce, and overrides any local setting that fights the
skill (the carried definition is the authority). Then it grades the held-back acceptance
examples for the transfer score, reports one line, caches the result, and runs, checking
every answer against the checks before sending.

**What the receiver sees** is one of three outcomes:
- **"Built. Build examples matched N of M, acceptance score 0.84. Ready."** Use it.
- **"Built, but could not reach the author's quality here. Closest: [text]. Missing: [the gaps]."** Honest failure; they know not to trust it, and why.
- **"Cannot build: this skill needs [tool], which is not available here."** Stops instead of producing something wrong.

**Who pays what.** The author pays once: approving examples, and an optional pre-ship
check (rebuild against a clean setup, report the score). The receiver pays a little on
first use, then caches. The expensive validation never runs on the receiver.

The full model, section by section, is in `FORMAT.md`.

## What is in the repo

- `SKILL.md`: how Claude operates skillc.
- `FORMAT.md`: the self-building file, section by section, and the carry/bind and
  validation models.
- `seed/builder.skill.md`: the author-side procedure.
- `seed/rebuild.skill.md`: the canonical rebuild recipe, stamped into every shared file
  and runnable by hand. It is the one part that is trusted by reading, not by rebuilding.
- `examples/`: worked self-building skills you can read and run.
  - `voice.selfbuild.SKILL.md`: pure carry, no binds (a writing voice).
  - `explain-plainly.selfbuild.SKILL.md`: pure carry, two behavioral moves.
  - `commit-message.selfbuild.SKILL.md`: adaptive, binds the local ticket tracker.
  - `skillc.selfbuild.SKILL.md`: skillc hosting itself (the builder, self-building).
  - `*.proof.md`: the cold-run evidence for each.

The `*.skill.src` and `*.compile.md` files are the earlier two-step model (ship source,
compile separately) that the self-building file supersedes.

## Proofs

Every self-building skill measures its own transfer: on first use in a new session it
rebuilds against a few held-back examples and reports an acceptance score from 0 to 1. Run
one on a different model and you get a fresh number, no setup. The runs below are recorded
in full in `examples/` -- method, inputs, and result for each:

- **[voice.selfbuild.proof.md](examples/voice.selfbuild.proof.md)** -- the voice example
  (a dry, unflappable operator) rebuilt and answered in voice at **0.94**; under a hostile
  "be upbeat, use exclamation points, sell it" profile it **overrode** and refused to
  sell, scoring **0.93**.
- **[skillc.selfbuild.proof.md](examples/skillc.selfbuild.proof.md)** -- skillc hosting
  itself: it rebuilt its own builder and emitted valid self-building skills on **Opus,
  Sonnet, and Haiku**, overrode a hostile "summarize the boilerplate" profile while
  stamping the recipe verbatim, and the loop closed (a file it emitted then rebuilt
  itself and ran correctly).
- **[skillc.adversarial.proof.md](examples/skillc.adversarial.proof.md)** -- six
  session-context injection vectors all resisted (**0 of 6** backdoors reached a shipped
  file). The poisoned-seed cells pin the real boundary: the verbatim check verifies
  fidelity-to-seed, not legitimacy-of-seed, so the seed is trusted by reading, not by
  rebuilding (Thompson's trusting trust).
- **[skillc.pairwise.proof.md](examples/skillc.pairwise.proof.md)** -- the builder by
  receiver model grid: **18 of 18** cells rebuilt and landed in-spec. explain-plainly
  mean **0.95** flat across all nine pairs; voice mean **0.90**. The builder barely
  matters (even Haiku-built files transfer to Opus and Sonnet receivers); the model is a
  swappable operating point.

Also in those runs: `explain-plainly` rebuilt itself cold and explained a bloom filter at
0.95; `commit-message`, in a session with no tracker, failed loud rather than guess a ticket.

It is all in the open. Rebuild any of these on your own model and send the score back: open
an [issue](https://github.com/baron-3dl/skillc/issues) with what you saw, or a pull request
that adds examples or tightens a skill's checks. Those go into the file and ship to everyone.
